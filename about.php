        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Born from a love for art and a desire to make beauty accessible, Canvas & Craft began as a small dream in a sunny room filled with brushes and beads.
            What started as handmade gifts for friends soon bloomed into a brand that celebrates authenticity, soul, and handcrafted elegance.
